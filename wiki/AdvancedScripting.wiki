== Contextual actions ==

There is two kinds of context which can be assigned to an execution script:
 * sprite : referring to an actor (character) or a simple entity
 * tile : referring to a tile position

In both context, special variables are allowed:
 * *x* and *y* : coordinates of the sprite/tile, each one on his referential
 * *self* : name of the character
 * *zildo.x* and *zildo.y* : hero's coordinates
 * *zildo.money* : hero's gold pieces amount
 * *zildo.angle.x* and *zildo.angle.y* : hero's angle coordinate (example: [0,-1] for north, [0,1] for east)
